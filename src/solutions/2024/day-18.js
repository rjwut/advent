/**
 * # [Advent of Code 2024 Day 18](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/18)
 *
 * This was quite the breather after the previous two puzzles! Fortunately, I already had utilities
 * that handled most of the work on this one.
 *
 * ## Part 1
 *
 * We have to compute the length of the shortest safe path through the grid after 1024 bytes
 * (obstacles) have been placed in the grid. So after parsing the input, we simply create an empty
 * grid of the correct size and iterate the first 1024 sets of coordinates in the input, marking the
 * corresponding cell for each one as blocked. Then we can use the
 * [A* algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm) to find the best path through.
 * The heuristic function is just the Manhattan distance from the current node to the goal.
 *
 * ## Part 2
 *
 * Now we have to detect which byte's placement causes the path to the goal to be blocked. We simply
 * continue to iterate where we left off, but we recompute the path after each byte until A*
 * reports that no path exists. As soon as that happens, the coordinates of the last byte placed are
 * the answer.
 *
 * Note that `SimpleGrid` works in terms of rows and columns, while the puzzle uses X,Y. This caused
 * nearly 10 minutes of head scratching for me, since I couldn't figure out what was wrong with my
 * part two answer until I realized I had the coordinates swapped!
 *
 * @param {string} input - the puzzle input
 * @returns {Array} - the puzzle answers
