 * # [Advent of Code 2020 Day 7](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/7)
 *
 * This is the first puzzle for 2020 where a brute force solution will likely
 * land you in trouble. The first order of business is to parse the rule
 * Regular expressions come to the rescue again: we can parse each sentence
 * with:
 * 
 * ```js
 * /^(?<color>\S+\s\S+) bags contain (?<contents>.+)\.$/
 * ```
 * 
 * ...and each `contents` clause with:
 * 
 * ```js
 * /(?<count>\d+)\s(?<color>\S+\s\S+) bag/g
 * ```
 * 
 * So to parse the input, I `map()` each line into an object with the following
 * properties:
 *
 * - `color` (string): The color of the containing bag.
 * - `contents` (array): An array of objects describing the contents of the
 *   bag:
 *   - `count` (number): The number of this type of bag
 *   - `color` (string): The color of the contained bag(s)
 * 
 * Part one asks how many different color bags can eventually contain a shiny
 * gold bag, while part two asks the total number of bags contained by a shiny
 * gold bag. Attempting to brute force this would be a prohibitively expensive
 * operation. So now that the rules are parsed, we can do some preprocessing
 * for each bag color to determine 1) the colors of all bags eventually
 * contained by that color of bag, and 2) the number of bags you're holding
 * (directly or indirectly) when you hold a bag of that color.
 * 
 * Let's use as an example the last five lines of the sample input:
 * 
 * ```txt
 * 1. shiny gold bags contain 1 dark olive bag, 2 vibrant plum bags.
 * 2. dark olive bags contain 3 faded blue bags, 4 dotted black bags.
 * 3. vibrant plum bags contain 5 faded blue bags, 6 dotted black bags.
 * 4. faded blue bags contain no other bags.
 * 5. dotted black bags contain no other bags.`;
 * ```
 * 
 * Let's start with the innermost bags, those which contain no other bags, so I
 * put rules #4 and #5 in a queue:
 * 
 * So first I process rule #4. Since nothing is inside it, it contains no other
 * colors of bags, and when you're holding a faded blue bag, you're only
 * holding one bag. So the precomputed results for faded blue bags are:
 * 
 * ```txt
 * {
 *   'faded blue': {
 *     colors: Set [],
 *     bags: 1,
 *   },
 * }
 * ```
 * 
 * Each time we finish computing a rule, we check to see if there are any rules
 * we haven't precomputed yet but whose contents are now all precomputed. There
 * are no rules which describe bags that only contain faded blue bags, so we
 * add nothing to the queue yet.
 * 
 * Now we take rule #5 off the queue and process it. Our precomputed results
 * now look like this:
 * 
 * ```txt
 * {
 *   'dotted black': {
 *     colors: Set [],
 *     bags: 1,
 *   },
 *   'faded blue': {
 *     colors: Set [],
 *     bags: 1,
 *   },
 * }
 * ```
 * 
 * We now have the information we need to do the computations for rules #2 and
 * #3, so we add them to queue. When we process a bag, the `colors` `Set` will
 * contain the colors of the directly contained bags, plus the colors in their
 * `colors` `Set`s; and the `bags` property will be set to the sum of the
 * `bags` properties of the directly contained bags plus 1. After they're
 * processed, our precomputed results look like this:
 * 
 * ```txt
 * {
 *   'dark olive': {
 *     colors: Set [ 'dotted black', 'faded blue' ],
 *     bags: 8,
 *   },
 *   'dotted black': {
 *     colors: Set [],
 *     bags: 1,
 *   },
 *   'faded blue': {
 *     colors: Set [],
 *     bags: 1,
 *   },
 *   'vibrant plum': {
 *     colors: Set [ 'dotted black', 'faded blue' ],
 *     bags: 12,
 *   },
 * }
 * ```
 * 
 * We finally have the information we need to compute for shiny gold bags, so
 * rule #1 goes on the queue. It's the only thing on the queue, so it gets
 * immediately processed:
 * 
 * ```txt
 * {
 *   'dark olive': {
 *     colors: Set [ 'dotted black', 'faded blue' ],
 *     bags: 8,
 *   },
 *   'dotted black': {
 *     colors: Set [],
 *     bags: 1,
 *   },
 *   'faded blue': {
 *     colors: Set [],
 *     bags: 1,
 *   },
 *   'shiny gold': {
 *     colors: set [ 'dark olive', 'dotted black', 'faded blue', 'vibrant plum' ],
 *     bags: 33,
 *   },
 *   'vibrant plum': {
 *     colors: Set [ 'dotted black', 'faded blue' ],
 *     bags: 12,
 *   },
 * }
 * ```
 * 
 * Once this processing has happened for all the rules in our input, solving
 * the two parts of the puzzle becomes trivial. For part one, we simply count
 * how many entries in our precomputed results contains 'shiny gold' in the
 * `colors` `Set`. For part two, we take the value of `bags` in the `shiny
 * gold` entry and subtract one (since we're not including the shiny gold bag
 * itself in the answer).
 *

 * @returns {Array} - the puzzle answers
